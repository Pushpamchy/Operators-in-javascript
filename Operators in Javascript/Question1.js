// The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write simple conditional statements in many programming languages. It is often used as a shorthand for an if-else statement. The syntax of the ternary operator generally follows this pattern:

// condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;


let a = 2;
// let c = a/2;

if (a % 2 == 0 ) {
    console.log("Even");
}

else {
    console.log ("Odd")
}
